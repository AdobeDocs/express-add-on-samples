            This is the mounting point for our Vue application.
            The <div id="app"></div> element is where Vue will render everything.
            
            When our index.js file runs app.mount('#app'), Vue attaches to this div
            and replaces its contents with the rendered components.
            
            In single-page applications (SPAs) like this one, Vue manages the entire UI
            from this single mounting point.

            The main JavaScript entry point for our application.
            This script is processed by webpack, which bundles all our JavaScript
            including Vue components into a single file.
            
            The "type="module"" attribute enables ES modules syntax (import/export)
            in the browser.
