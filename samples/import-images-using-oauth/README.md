## About

This Add-on project has been created with _@adobe/create-ccweb-add-on_. As an example, this Add-on demonstrates how to use the Add-on SDK's OAuth API to allow its users to connect their Dropbox account.

Besides the OAuth API, this Add-On also makes use of the other Add-on SDK APIs, such as the:

-   Import API: To add images from the Add-on to the document.
-   Drag and Drop API: To support dragging and dropping images to the document.
-   Client Storage API: To store the `access_token` in the IndexedDB store of the browser and reusing the same for the requests made to the Dropbox APIs.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** The `generateAccessToken()` implementation inside the `OAuthUtils.js` file might vary depending on the **OAuth Provider** you are using. Please follow the instructions in your specific OAuth Provider's docs to modify `OAuthUtils.js`.
